# MVC Goals
* Small and simple in design.
* Simple ORM with easy access to related tables.
* Allow the use of SQL.
* Hydrated models.
* Can run on old PHP 5.6 or newer versions allowing you to host anywhere.
* Allow the use of composer to have access to others code.
* Reuse others code when appropriate (no need to reinvent the wheel).
