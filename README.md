# MVC Goals
*Small and simple in design.
*Simple ORM with easy access to related tables.
*Allow the use of SQL.
*Hydrated models.
*Can run on oldish or newer versions of PHP (host anywhere).
*Allow the use of composer for the use of others code.
*Reuse others code when appropriate (no need to reinvent the wheel).
